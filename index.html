        <h2> Short biography </h2>
        
        <p id="bio-body"> 
          I received my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering with a Physics minor from the Ohio State University in May, 2013. In September, 2013, I joined Professor Shanhui Fan's group as a Ph.D. student in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University, California. In 2014, I was awarded the Stanford Graduate Fellowship. I am expected to defend my thesis in Spring, 2018. 
        </p>

        <p>
          My research topics include non-magnetic optical isolation, numerical electrodynamics, meta-materials and meta-surfaces, and radiative thermal management. I have authored and co-authored more than 10 journal articals and have given several conference talks. In addition, I have written and published a number of numerical software for photonic design and optimization. For more information regarding to my work, check out the Research, Software, and Publications page, as well as the links below.
