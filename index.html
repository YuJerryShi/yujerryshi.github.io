        <p id="bio-body"> 
          I am currently an Electrical Engineering Ph.D. student working with Professor 
          <a class="text-link" href="https://web.stanford.edu/~shanhui/">Shanhui Fan</a>
          at 
          <a class="text-link" href="https://ee.stanford.edu/"> Stanford University</a>. I received my Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a Physics minor from 
          <a class="text-link" href="https://ece.osu.edu/">The Ohio State University</a>
          in May, 2013, and I obtained my Master's degree in Electrical Engineering at Stanford in 2015. I am expected to defend my thesis in Spring 2018.

        <p id="bio-body">
          My research topics include non-magnetic optical isolation, numerical electrodynamics, meta-materials and meta-surfaces, and radiative thermal management. I have authored and co-authored more than 15 journal articles and have given several conference talks. In addition, I have written and published a number of numerical software for photonic design and optimization.
